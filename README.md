## Description

The purpose of this package is to facilitate in the creation of the skeleton of
a vim plugin. This can hopefully:

- Accelerate the overall plugin development process
- Provide consistency across all my plugins

## TODO

- [ ] Add vim-pack as package manager
- [X] Add suite tests with Vader
